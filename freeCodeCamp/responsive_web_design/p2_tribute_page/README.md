# üèÜ Build a Tribute Page

### **Objective:**
Build an app that is functionally similar to [this tribute page](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks). **Do not copy** this demo project.

## **User Stories:**

- Your tribute page should have a `<main>` element with an `id` of `main`, which contains all other elements.
- You should see an element with an `id` of `title`, containing text that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g., **"Dr. Norman Borlaug"**).
- You should see either a `<figure>` or `<div>` element with an `id` of `img-div`.
- Inside the `#img-div` element:
  - You should have an `<img>` element with an `id` of `image`.
  - You should have an element with an `id` of `img-caption`, containing text describing the image.
- You should see an element with an `id` of `tribute-info`, containing text about the subject of the tribute page.
- You should see an `<a>` element with an `id` of `tribute-link`, linking to an **external** site with additional information.
  - **Hint:** Add `target="_blank"` so the link opens in a new tab.
- Your `#image` should use `max-width` and `height` properties to resize **responsively** relative to its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
- Your `<img>` element should be **centered** within its parent element.

### **Final Steps:**
Fulfill the user stories and pass all tests to complete this project. **Give it your own personal style.** Happy Coding! üé®üöÄ
